# GenderRobustness: Robustness of Gender Detection in Facial Recognition Systems with variation in Image Properties

  - Paper in progress : https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.10472.pdf

In the last 2 years, facial recognition systems have claimed to have made their gender detection module more accurate
and that they have trained the model on a more diverse dataset. Yet, in this paper, we present our findings on variations in gender detection of images when subjected to changes in image properties like brightness, sharpness, contrast as
well as on a combination of these factors as opposed to just a single factor. We aim to test on different publicly available facial recognition systems for gender bias on a face dataset, which we have tried to make as diverse as possible in order to produce accurate results, and generate a comparative
study.
